# Boggle_AndrewMorin

The boggle game I created. The rules are very simple, click and drag to select letters. You have 3 minutes to play. \n

Known Bugs:\n
  1)Sometimes certain letters aren't recognized immediately when you hover over them. I know it is an issue with the stack pane, but I did
    not have time to fix this issue.\n
  2)The scroll pane will not go to the most recently guessed word, it is always one behind. I know it's an issue of when I am implementing     value, but it is not fixed as of today.\n
  
To check out earlier versions, the first three versions are all set as seperate branches. The most current is in the main branch, but you can access all versions from the branches.
